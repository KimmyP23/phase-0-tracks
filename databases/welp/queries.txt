You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

Command: 
SELECT * FROM reviews, users, businesses WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

1|5|Best Sushi I've ever had|3|2|2|Daisy|Riddler|3|Sushi World
2|5|Great workout place|1|1|1|Chris|Johnson|1|Lotus Yoga
3|1|Terrible service|2|3|3|Kyle|Jacobs|2|5 Star Diner
4|3|Conviently located|4|4|4|Carrie|James|4|Joe's Coffee Brew

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

Command:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

Daisy|Riddler|Sushi World|5|Best Sushi I've ever had

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

Command:
SELECT * FROM reviews, users, businesses WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND businesses.name = "Sushi World";
