#pseudocode:
#ask user for information: client name, age, number of children, decor theme, city, fav color, on a budget
#use conversion to make sure that user input is in the appropiate data type; age -> integer, city ->string, on a budget -> true/false
#ask user if they would like to make any changes to their input
#create branches to accommodate any updates using if statements and then update any given variable
#open a new hash name:interior design client
#add each key and value to the hash
