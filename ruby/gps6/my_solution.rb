# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Greg Garner ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
#require_relative allows a file to gain access to another file within the same directory
#require has access to any file anywhere on the computer; access to gems 

require_relative 'state_data'
require 'pry'

class VirusPredictor
#initialize instance of the VirusPredictor class with attributes of @state, @population, @population_density
  def initialize(state_of_origin, population_density, population)

    @population = population
    @population_density = population_density
  end
  
#calls two methods
  def virus_effects
    predicted_deaths
    speed_of_spread

  def predicted_deaths

  end

  def speed_of_spread #in months
    # We are still perfecting our formula here. The speed is also affected
    # by additional factors we haven't added into this functionality.

# DRIVER CODE
 # initialize VirusPredictor for each state


# alabama = VirusPredictor.new("Alabama", STATE_DATA["Alabama"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["Alabama"][:population])
# alabama.virus_effects

# jersey = VirusPredictor.new("New Jersey", STATE_DATA["New Jersey"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["New Jersey"][:population])
# jersey.virus_effects

# california = VirusPredictor.new("California", STATE_DATA["California"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["California"][:population])
# california.virus_effects

# alaska = VirusPredictor.new("Alaska", STATE_DATA["Alaska"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["Alaska"][:population])
# alaska.virus_effects


STATE_DATA.each do |state, population_info|
  # binding.pry
 VirusPredictor.new(state, population_info[:population_density], population_info[:population]).virus_effects
end


#=======================================================================
# Reflection Section
# The difference is that the hash rocket is a bit oudated while the symbol method is the newer way of assigning in hashes. The hash rocket can be used to assign into both a string and a symbol, while the colon/symbol method is used for assigning into a symbol.

# Require_relative is needed to access the data in the other file. Require allows you to access data anywhere on your computer. require_relative allows you to use a path within the directory.

# Some ways to iterate through a hash are the each method and the map method.

# Virus effects was just using instance variables, therefore none of them were required to be passed into the methods.

# This challenge really helped me with refactoring and what to look for when I am refactoring. Not to change code for the sake of changing it, but to make it less DRY.
