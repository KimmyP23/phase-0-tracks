<!-- HTML5 semantic tags allow your document to be organized so that your docment is more readable and accessible to people with disabilities. I talso standardizes between development teams.
I like the nav and section tags also I think the main tag is already implied.
Sublime can create shortcuts to templates that you ca customized to your own liking.
It was hard to understand to visualize the article tag that most. I would like to see how it is used day to day. The more I come across the topic the more I will understand it! -->
